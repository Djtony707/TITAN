🚀 **Just launched TITAN - The Intelligent Task Automation Network**

The AI agent platform that thinks, learns, and improves itself. Built in Rust. Designed for safety. Ready for autonomy.

**Why TITAN?**

While other AI agents give skills full system access (dangerous), TITAN:
✅ Sandboxes everything in WASM 
✅ Mandates approvals for sensitive operations
✅ Captures failures and learns from them
✅ Spawns sub-agents for parallel tasks (like Claude Code's 16-agent breakthrough)

**What Makes It Different:**

🔒 Security-First: WASM sandboxing + mandatory approvals (A+ security audit)
🧠 Self-Improving: Error pattern recognition + strategy updates  
🎭 Reasoning Personas: Engineer, Devil's Advocate, Gonzo, Precedent modes
🤖 Multi-Agent: Spawn specialist agents for complex tasks
📡 MCP Native: Industry-standard protocol support

**I'm Looking For:**

🔧 Rust developers - Core architecture, WASM runtime
🛡️ Security engineers - Threat modeling, penetration testing
🎨 UI/UX designers - Web dashboard, Discord interfaces
📝 Technical writers - Documentation, tutorials
🧪 QA engineers - Test suites, CI/CD
💡 AI/ML engineers - Prompt engineering, agent orchestration

**Tech Stack:** Rust, Wasmtime, SQLite, Serenity, Axum

**Title:** TITAN - A security-first AI agent platform in Rust with WASM sandboxing and self-improvement

Just launched TITAN (The Intelligent Task Automation Network) - an open-source AI agent platform built in Rust.

**What it does:**
- Runs AI agents locally with WASM sandboxing
- Spawns sub-agents for parallel tasks
- Self-improves by capturing and learning from failures
- Mandatory approvals for sensitive operations

**Why Rust:**
Memory safety without GC, perfect for a security-focused project. WASM integration is first-class.

**Looking for:**
Rust contributors! Core runtime, WASM sandbox, Discord bot, web dashboard.

**Repo:** https://github.com/Djtony707/TITAN

Happy to answer questions!

## Hacker News (Show HN)

**Title:** Show HN: TITAN – AI agent platform with WASM sandboxing and self-improvement

TITAN (The Intelligent Task Automation Network) is an open-source AI agent platform I built in Rust.

**Key differentiators:**
- WASM sandboxing for all skills (unlike OpenClaw/AutoGPT which run unsandboxed)
- Self-improving error handling (captures failures, updates strategies)
- Multi-agent orchestration (spawn sub-agents like Claude Code's breakthrough)
- Mandatory approvals for WRITE/EXEC/NET operations
- A+ security audit rating

**Tech:** Rust, Wasmtime, SQLite, Serenity (Discord), Axum

The goal was to build an AI agent platform where security isn't an afterthought. All skills run in wasmtime with WASI, secrets are isolated, and there's a full audit trail.

Looking for contributors - especially Rust devs and security engineers.
