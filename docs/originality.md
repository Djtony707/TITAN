# TITAN Originality Statement

TITAN is an original implementation inspired by public concepts in agent systems.

## Policy

1. TITAN does not copy code from third-party repositories unless explicitly documented.
2. High-level ideas (for example: workspace model, skills model, channel adapters) may inform design decisions, but implementation is written for TITAN with its own structure and code.
3. Any copied third-party code must be tracked in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` with license obligations preserved.

## Current Status

As of February 20, 2026:
- No third-party code has been copied into TITAN.
- Any third-party reuse must be documented in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

## Branding

TITAN maintains distinct branding and naming and does not reuse third-party branding assets.
