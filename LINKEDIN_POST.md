# LinkedIn Post - TITAN Project Announcement

---

🚀 **Just launched TITAN - The Intelligent Task Automation Network**

The AI agent platform that thinks, learns, and improves itself. Built in Rust. Designed for safety. Ready for autonomy.

## Why TITAN?

While other AI agents give skills full system access (dangerous), TITAN:
✅ Sandboxes everything in WASM 
✅ Mandates approvals for sensitive operations
✅ Captures failures and learns from them
✅ Spawns sub-agents for parallel tasks (like Claude Code's 16-agent breakthrough)

## What Makes It Different

🔒 **Security-First**: WASM sandboxing + mandatory approvals (A+ security audit)
🧠 **Self-Improving**: Error pattern recognition + strategy updates
🎭 **Reasoning Personas**: Engineer, Devil's Advocate, Gonzo, Precedent modes
🤖 **Multi-Agent**: Spawn specialist agents for complex tasks
📡 **MCP Native**: Industry-standard protocol support

## The Competition

| Platform | Security | Local-First | Self-Improving | Multi-Agent |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| TITAN | ✅ A+ | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| OpenClaw | ❌ Weak | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| AutoGPT | ❌ Poor | ❌ Cloud | ❌ No | ⚠️ Limited |
| CrewAI | ⚠️ Okay | ❌ Cloud | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

## I'm Looking For

🔧 **Rust developers** - Core architecture, WASM runtime, async systems
🛡️ **Security engineers** - Threat modeling, penetration testing, audits
🎨 **UI/UX designers** - Web dashboard, Discord interfaces
📝 **Technical writers** - Documentation, tutorials, blog posts
🧪 **QA engineers** - Test suites, CI/CD, benchmarking
💡 **AI/ML engineers** - Prompt engineering, agent orchestration

## Tech Stack

- Rust 1.75+ (memory safety without GC)
- Wasmtime (WASI sandboxing)
- SQLite (embedded, zero-config)
- Serenity (Discord bot)
- Axum (web dashboard)

## Get Involved

📁 **GitHub**: https://github.com/Djtony707/TITAN
💬 **Discord**: https://discord.gg/titan (coming soon)
📧 **Email**: hello@titan.sh

This is an open-source project with MIT license. Looking for contributors who want to build the future of secure, autonomous AI agents.

If you're passionate about:
- AI safety and security
- Local-first software
- Multi-agent systems
- Self-improving systems

...I'd love to hear from you! Drop a comment or DM me.
